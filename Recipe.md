Step 1 :
Prep up everything before you start with preparing the sandwiches. Boil the potatoes and then slice them in rounds. Chop the cucumber, tomatoes and onions in thin round slices. Prepare the green chutney.

Step 2 :
On slices of whole wheat bread or brown bread or white bread, spread butter followed with green chutney. The butter has to be spread evenly and a bit liberally (if you prefer) so that on applying the chutney, the bread does not become soggy.

Step 3 :
place a few slices of potatoes and then sprinkle with one to two pinches of chaat masala and roasted cumin powder.

Step 4 :
Place a few tomato, cucumber and onion slices over the bread. Sprinkle with one to two pinches or more of chaat masala, roasted cumin powder and black salt.

Step 5 :
cover the vegetable topped slices with the remaining buttered and chutneyed slices of bread. Spread butter on the top of the slices.

Step 6 :
Preheat the grill. When the grill is ready, gently place the buttered side facing the bottom of the grill, making sure your hands donâ€™t touch the grill (be careful when doing this. If you cannot do this then just skip the above step. Instead spread butter once the sandwiches are grilled). Now spread butter on the top side which is facing you.

Step 8 :
Close the grill and then grill the sandwiches for 2-3 minutes or till golden. Remove the grilled sandwiches with a wooden spatula.

Step 9 :
Serve veg grilled sandwich hot with green chutney or tomato sauce
